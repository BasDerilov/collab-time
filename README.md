# Collab-time

Our first collab project

## Dependencies

The only thing you need installed to run the app is NodeJS and git.

## How to run

Getting the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/BasDerilov/collab-time.git && cd collab-time`

To install all dependencies:

`npm install`

Running the dev environment:

`npm run dev`

Building for production (hypothetically)

`npm run build`

The compiled static files should appear in the dist folder if parcel is configured correctly (by default)
